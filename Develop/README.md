# Note Taker

## Description

Welcome to my Note Taker Full-Stack Application! 
This website has a database using express js for note titles and descriptions, as well as being able to delete notes using the trash can icon button next to each one, their unique ID would be their position in the array and then the database is spliced with that index to remove the desired item.
